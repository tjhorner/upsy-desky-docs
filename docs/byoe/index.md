# BYOE (Bring-Your-Own-Enclosure)

If you are building your own Upsy Desky or you simply didn't opt to include an enclosure in your order, you can print your own so that everything looks nice and clean.

## Materials

To mount the board properly inside of the enclosure, you will also need some hardware:

- 2 M3x4mm machine screws
- 1 M2x4mm machine screw

To stick the enclosure to the underside of your desk you can use any double-sided adhesive, but I really like [3M VHB tape](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Scotch-5952-VHB-Tape/dp/B01BT0A6MG) &mdash; it's what I ship with the enclosures.

## 3D Model Files

The enclosure comes in two parts &mdash; the case and the cover. You can download a ZIP containing STL files for each of these parts at this link: [Download STL Files](./enclosure.zip)

## Assembly

1. Take the board and angle it so that the USB-C port aligns with the hole on the enclosure.
2. Slide the board in, making sure the USB-C port remains aligned.
3. Once the USB-C port is seated inside the hole, press down on the board.
4. Use the screws to mount the board to the enclosure. **Be sure not to tighten too much**; just enough to be snug.
5. Snap the cover onto the case at an angle. **Note that the cover has an indentation for the RJ45 jacks**; ensure that it is aligned properly.

At this point you can finalize the installation by sticking the Upsy Desky on the underside of your desk. Ta-da!
