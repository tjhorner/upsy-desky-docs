:::note
If your control box isn't listed here, this doesn't necessarily mean it's incompatible; it just means that nobody has tested it yet. See the page on [assessing compatibility](./assessing-compatibility.mdx) to see if it may be compatible.

## Caveats

### JCB36N2A-110

If you are having issues with this model control box, you may need to [adopt the device](../../advanced/customization/index.md) and add this to your ESPHome config:

```yaml
substitutions:
  standing_desk_variant: uplift
```

The auto-detection may not work properly, so forcing it to use the correct decoder will fix this.
