# Troubleshooting & Support

## Support

If you are having issues with your Upsy Desky, help is available in several places:

- The below troubleshooting guide covers many common issues
- The [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZHfXKQrSxF) is a great place to get help from me and the rest of the community
- The [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tjhorner/upsy-desky/issues) might have the solution to a problem you're having

Please do note that support is provided on a best-effort basis. I will of course assist in any way I can, but since this is not my full-time job I cannot guarantee that I will be able to help immediately or with every situation. If you are interested in a more formal support arrangement, please [contact me via email](mailto:biz@tjhorner.dev) and we can work something out. Thank you for understanding.

## Common Issues

### I don't see the Wi-Fi network during setup

If you don't see a Wi-Fi network starting with `upsy-desky` while the unit is powered, the best thing to try is re-flashing the firmware. If you have a Chromium-based browser, you can do it directly from the web without any downloads. [Flash it here](https://shop.horner.tj/things/upsy-desky/setup/stock), and see if the issue persists. If it does, please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZHfXKQrSxF) for support.

### I can't connect to my hidden Wi-Fi network

This is unfortunately a limitation of ESPHome â€” the [Wi-Fi configuration](https://esphome.io/components/wifi.html#configuration-variables) requires that `fast_connect` is enabled for hidden networks, but this cannot be enabled without setting a network in the configuration itself, so I cannot enable this for the stock firmware.

Essentially, you will need to [adopt your Upsy Desky in the ESPHome dashboard](../advanced/customization/index.md) then modify the Wi-Fi configuration to have the `fast_connect` option.

### The desk height is not being reported properly

You may wish to try re-detecting the decoder to use:

1. Press the up or down button on your desk's keypad briefly. This will wake up the control box.
2. In Home Assistant or the web UI, press the [Re-Detect Decoder](../reference/entities.md#re-detect-decoder) button. This will cycle through each decoder and attempt to determine the correct one.

You can gain more insight into the process by [viewing the logs](#collecting-logs) before starting re-detection.

If you encounter this issue multiple times, it may be worth adding the correct decoder in the firmware configuration so it no longer needs to detect it at every boot. Perform this process one more time, taking note of the decoder that is detected, then [add it to the firmware configuration](../advanced/customization/index.md) with these lines:

```yaml
substitutions:
  standing_desk_variant: "YOUR_DECODER_HERE" # Replace this
```

If none of the decoders work, then your desk may use a protocol that is thus-far undiscovered. You can check out the [reverse engineering guide](../advanced/reverse-engineering/index.md) to learn how to add support for your desk. If you run into any trouble, there are several people in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZHfXKQrSxF) who have experience with this process and can help you out.

### The stock keypad no longer shows the desk's height

This is an issue that can occur on some brands of control box. To address it, follow these steps:

1. Unplug everything from your Upsy Desky.
2. Connect the control box to your Upsy Desky.
3. Wait for the Upsy Desky to start up fully (around 10 seconds).
4. Plug in the keypad.

If these steps don't work, first unuplug your desk then repeat them.

The issue should be fixed until the next time power is lost. If you encounter it again, simply repeat the steps. A permanent fix is in the works, but this workaround will suffice for now. Apologies for the inconvenience!

### Home Assistant can't connect / `BAD_INDICATOR errno=11`

If Home Assistant can't connect to your Upsy Desky, or you are receiving the error `Reading failed: BAD_INDICATOR errno=11` in the logs, this indicates Home Assistant may be trying to connect with an incorrect encryption key. First, try restarting Home Assistant entirely to see if the issue persists. If it does, here are some things to try based on how you manage your Upsy Desky's firmware updates.

#### OTA Updates / Firmware Binary

The pre-compiled firmware binaries that are used for OTA updates do not have an API encryption key built-in, therefore Home Assistant must be attempting to connect with an encryption key or deprecated API password. To remedy this, please try removing the integration entry for your Upsy Desky by going to **Settings > Devices &amp; Services**, then remove the ESPHome integration for your Upsy Desky there. Then re-add your Upsy Desky to Home Assistant by creating a new ESPHome integration using the device's IP or hostname. Do not specify an encryption key or password if prompted.

#### ESPHome Dashboard

If you manage updates with an ESPHome YAML, you must make sure that the encryption key you specify in the `api:` section of your configuration matches the encryption key that Home Assistant uses. Try re-adding the integration to Home Assistant, and make sure to specify the encryption key when prompted. You may also try removing the encryption key from your configuration to see if this remedies the issue. If it does, this may indicate an issue with Home Assistant or ESPHome itself.

### Upsy Desky is powered with USB-C, but not with the control box

If your Upsy Desky can be powered with USB-C but is not powered by your desk's control box (or you are seeing strange power-related behavior), then the first thing you want to check is that you are using a short, high-quality cable. Using a long or lower-quality cable can affect power delivery to the unit and cause issues. I recommend using a CAT6 cable with 24 AWG wires or better, and no longer than 1 meter. [This cable from Monoprice](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Cat6-Ethernet-Patch-Cable/dp/B002RBECAE) should work well.

If you are indeed using a high-quality cable, then it's possible that your desk's control box simply can't provide the current necessary to power the Upsy Desky. It does take up more power than the stock keypad, so this is a possibility. Luckily, you can provide supplemental power via the USB-C port while it's also plugged into the control box; this should resolve any power-related issues you are seeing.

### I updated ESPHome and the firmware doesn't compile

If you are managing your firmware via ESPHome and a recent ESPHome update has caused the firmware to fail compilation, please make sure that your configuration packages are up-to-date. You can check the latest version of the config packages [here](https://github.com/tjhorner/upsy-desky/releases/latest). For example, if the latest version is v4.0.0, your `packages` section should look something like this:

```yaml
packages:
  tj_horner.upsy_desky: github://tjhorner/upsy-desky/firmware/stock.yaml@v4.0.0
```

## Other Issues

If you are experiencing other issues, here are some things to try:

- Restart your desk's control box. Sometimes it can get in a weird state which the Upsy Desky cannot recover from.
- Disconnect and re-connect the Upsy Desky to the control box.
- Reflash the firmware [here](https://shop.horner.tj/things/upsy-desky/setup/stock).

If all else fails, please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZHfXKQrSxF) for support. If necessary, we will work to triage an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Collecting Logs

If you are experiencing issues with the Upsy Desky, it may be helpful to collect logs from the device. You can collect the logs from the web UI or via serial.

To collect the logs via USB serial right in your browser, click the Connect button below, choose your Upsy Desky, then "Logs &amp; Console".
