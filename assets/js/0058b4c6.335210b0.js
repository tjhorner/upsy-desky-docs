This was compounded by the fact that the stock firmware also included the web server component, which ESPHome explicitly discourages due to the performance impact of both components.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"advanced/customization/index":{"id":"advanced/customization/index","title":"Firmware Customization","description":"Since the Upsy Desky\'s firmware is based on ESPHome, making customizations to the firmware is as easy as editing some YAML. The best way to modify the firmware config is by installing the ESPHome Dashboard (or using it via cli).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"advanced/reverse-engineering/index":{"id":"advanced/reverse-engineering/index","title":"Reverse Engineering Guide","description":"If your desk is not officially supported, or if you are having issues with functionality like getting or setting desk height, presets, etc. and have followed the Troubleshooting steps, then it is very possible that your desk uses a protocol that the firmware does not yet understand.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"byoe/index":{"id":"byoe/index","title":"BYOE (Bring-Your-Own-Enclosure)","description":"If you are building your own Upsy Desky or you simply didn\'t opt to include an enclosure in your order, you can print your own so that everything looks nice and clean.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/decoders/index":{"id":"configuration/decoders/index","title":"Decoders","description":"Since firmware 1.0.0, it is no longer required to manually configure the decoder. It will automatically determine the correct one to use during startup. See Auto-Detection for more information.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/index":{"id":"configuration/index","title":"Configuration","description":"Once you have connected your Upsy Desky to your network, you can configure it by going to its IP address (port 80), or by visiting the device page in Home Assistant.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/presets/index":{"id":"configuration/presets/index","title":"Presets","description":"Most standing desk control boxes have the ability to store presets \u2014 usually up to 4. The Upsy Desky exposes the ability to set and recall these presets through virtual buttons.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/renaming/index":{"id":"configuration/renaming/index","title":"Renaming the Device","description":"By default, the name of your Upsy Desky in Home Assistant is upsy-desky-XXXXXX, where XXXXXX is derived from the MAC address of the device. This is not very descriptive, so you can change it to something more meaningful.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"firmware-updates":{"id":"firmware-updates","title":"Firmware Updates","description":"To get the latest features and bug fixes, you will need to update your Upsy Desky\'s firmware. There are a few ways to do this, and we will go over each of them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started":{"id":"getting-started","title":"Getting Started","description":"This page will guide you through setting up your new Upsy Desky with your home automation system and your standing desk. This will take less than ten minutes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integrations/home-assistant":{"id":"integrations/home-assistant","title":"Home Assistant","description":"Since the firmware is based on ESPHome, Home Assistant can be integrated seamlessly with the Upsy Desky. This is the recommended way to integrate the Upsy Desky with other devices in your home, and the best way to create automations due to the wide range of integrations available for Home Assistant.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integrations/hubitat":{"id":"integrations/hubitat","title":"Hubitat","description":"There is budding unofficial support for ESPHome-based projects on Hubitat.

It allows you to set your desired standing and sitting height, and switch between them after a set amount of time during your workday. It also inludes ICS integration so as not to interrupt you during meetings.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"What is this thing?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/api":{"id":"reference/api","title":"HTTP API","description":"The stock firmware enables ESPHome\'s Web Server component, which in turn enables an HTTP API (on port 80). Since the stock firmware exposes a sensor for reporting the current desk height, and a number to set the target height, you can use these simple HTTP endpoints to write your integrations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/compatibility/assessing-compatibility":{"id":"reference/compatibility/assessing-compatibility","title":"Assessing Compatibility","description":"If your desk\'s control box model number is not in the compatibility list, this doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s unsupported, just that nobody has tested it yet. You can assess whether your desk may be compatible using the steps below. If all the conditions are satisfied, you may be eligible to receive a unit for testing, free of charge.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/compatibility/index":{"id":"reference/compatibility/index","title":"Desk Compatibility","description":"Verified Desks","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"reference/entities":{"id":"reference/entities","title":"Entities","description":"The Upsy Desky firmware exposes many entities by default.
